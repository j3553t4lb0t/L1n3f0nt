Hi again!

This is my second website. I think I'm doing okay so far.
Did you ever come up with a secret glyph code with a friend in grade school? Lines and dots you would use to 
pass notes in class without worrying about if the teacher or a peer might see what you wrote?
Linefont is a variable font created by Dmitry Ivanov. It's a widget font, made to create graphics with our 
keyboards. Each letter creates a different mark, that creates the opportunity language.

In this project, I attempted to display this font in a new way, in a linguistic way. It's variable festures 
are enticing, but the core concept kept me hooked. Alongside Linefont, this site also shows Jost*, a font 
created and distributed by Indestructible Type*.

This is the first project where I have attempted to use CSS grid, there are still roadblocks, and certain 
things I don't fully understand, but overall it was a successful attempt.
Creating an interactive portion of this site was a hurdle, one I overcame thanks to Google.
I'd like to again thank Lara Henderson, for teaching this valuable course, as well as Dmitry Ivanov for 
creating something so reminiscent of middle school notes written in glittery pink gel pen; Surely not what he 
intended.

Onto the next thing, I guess. See you in a few weeks !!
